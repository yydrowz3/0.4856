ZooKeeper FAQ

Q: What's the main take-away from this paper?

A: ZooKeeper's main academic contribution lies in the detailed design
of a storage system specialized to fault-tolerant high-performance
configuration management: watches, sessions, the choice of
consistency, the specific semantics of the operations. It builds on
existing work such as Chubby and Paxos.

A lot of what's interesting for us is the idea that one can obtain
fault tolerance by keeping the critical state in fault-tolerant
storage (ZooKeeper), and running the computation in non-fault-tolerant
servers. For example, a MapReduce coordinator might keep state about
jobs, task status, workers, location of intermediate output, &c, in
ZooKeeper. If the coordinator fails, a new computer can be selected to
run the MapReduce coordinator software, and it can load its state from
ZooKeeper. This provides fault-tolerance for the coordinator without
the complexity of state-machine replication (e.g. without having to
write the MapReduce coordinator using a Raft library). You can think
of this as providing fault-tolerance by making the state alone
fault-tolerant, whereas use of Raft makes the entire computation
fault-tolerant. This general pattern isn't new -- for example it's how
database-backed web sites work -- but ZooKeeper is a good fit if your
main concern is managing fault-tolerant services.

Q: What's the point of sessions?

A: A session consists of some state maintained by the client and
ZooKeeper. The client tags each request with its session ID. If
ZooKeeper doesn't hear from a client for a while because the client
has failed or there's a network problem, the ZooKeeper leader will
expire (destroy) the session.

One role of sessions is to manage the state required to guarantee FIFO
client order, and to keep track of each client's watches.

More importantly, sessions are involved in the way ephemeral znodes
work. When a client creates an ephemeral znode, ZooKeeper remembers
which client session created the znode. If the ZooKeeper leader expires
a session, then it will also delete all ephemeral znodes created by
that session. In addition, and atomically with deleting the ephemeral
znodes, ZooKeeper guarantees to ignore any further client requests from
the expired session.

This arrangement works particularly well when applications implement
elections with ZooKeeper, e.g. to elect a GFS or MapReduce
coordinator. A typical election scheme: the candidates all try to
create the same ephemeral znode; ZooKeeper allows only one of the
creates to succeed (create is "exclusive"); the candidate whose create
succeeded is the winner. Use of an ephemeral znode means that if
ZooKeeper decides the winner has failed, ZooKeeper will automatically
expire its session and delete the znode, so that there can be a new
election. The ephemeral znode and session act as a lease.

But what if the original winner is actually alive, and continues to
act as e.g. GFS coordinator even after ZooKeeper deletes its ephemeral
znode and a new election is held? Because ZooKeeper starts ignoring a
session's requests at the moment ZooKeeper expires the session and
deletes the ephemeral znode, the original winner will automatically be
prevented from changing anything stored in ZooKeeper. Assuming the
application store all state in ZooKeeper, this prevents the deposed
winner from interfering with the new winner. This idea is sometimes
called "fencing."

Q: The paper's Section 2.4 describes locks. What if one used these
locks to protect a group of updates to a set of znodes, and the lock
holder crashed while only halfway through those updates? How could the
application recover?

A: One part of the answer is that ZooKeeper's ephemeral znode
mechanism would cause the lock file to disappear, so that another
client could acquire the lock.

The new lock-holder would be faced with partially-updated data, and
would need a strategy for recovering. This situation is similar to
crash recovery in databases, and the possible solutions are similar at
a high level. For example, the updates could take the form of writes
to newly created files, so that the if the new lock holder doesn't see
a complete set of new files, it would know to fall back on the
previous set. The section 2.3 "ready" znode scheme works like this.

Q: How does A-linearizability differ from linearizability?

A: A ZooKeeper client can send lots of "asynchronous" requests, without
waiting for each to finish before sending the next. By the rules of
ordinary linearizability, these requests are concurrent (they overlap in
time), and therefor can be executed in any order. In contrast, ZooKeeper
guarantees to execute them in the order that the client sent them. The
paper calls this A-linearizability.

Q: Why are only update requests A-linearizable? Why not reads as well?

A: The authors want high total read throughput, so they want ZooKeeper
replicas to be able to satisfy client reads and maintain watches
without involving the leader. A given replica may not know about a
committed write (if it's not in the majority that the leader waited
for), or may know about a write but not yet know if it is committed.
Thus a replica's state may lag behind the leader and other replicas.
Thus serving reads from replicas can yield data that doesn't reflect
recent writes -- that is, reads can return stale results.

Q: How does linearizability differ from serializability?

A: The usual definition of serializability is much like
linearizability, but without the requirement that operations respect
real-time ordering. Have a look at this explanation:
http://www.bailis.org/blog/linearizability-versus-serializability/

Section 2.3 of the ZooKeeper paper uses "serializable" to indicate
that the system behaves as if writes (from all clients combined) were
executed one by one in some order. The "FIFO client order" property
means that reads occur at specific points in the order of writes, and
that a given client's successive reads never move backwards in that
order. Note that the guarantees for writes and reads are different.

Q: Why is it OK for ZooKeeper to respond to read requests with
out-of-date data?

A: ZooKeeper is likely to yield data that is only slightly out of
date: the leader tries hard to keep all the followers up to date, much
as in Raft. So a follower may be a few writes (or batches of writes)
behind the leader, but rarely much more than that.

Most uses of ZooKeeper have no problem with slightly-out-of-date read
results. After all, even if ZooKeeper guaranteed to provide fresh
results as of the time ZooKeeper executed the read, those results could
easily be out of date by the time the reply arrived at the client.
Because some other client might send a write request to ZooKeeper just
after ZooKeeper replied to the read.

A typical use of ZooKeeper is for a MapReduce worker to register
itself and look for work, perhaps in a ZooKeeper directory in which
the MR coordinator writes task assignments. Suppose the worker checks
for work every 10 seconds, or uses a ZooKeeper watch to be notified of
any change in work assignments. In both cases, the worker is likely to
hear about a new assignment somewhat after the assignment was made.
But a little delay does not matter much (as long as each item of work
is relatively long).

One situation where ZooKeeper's read semantics might cause trouble is
if different clients compare notes. Client C1 might perform a read and
see a new value; and after that, client C2 might perform a read and
see an older value. This cannot happen in a linearizable system, but
it can happen with ZooKeeper.

Q: What is pipelining?

A: There are two things going on here. First, the ZooKeeper leader
(really the leader's Zab layer) batches together multiple client
operations in order to send them efficiently over the network, and in
order to efficiently write them to disk. For both network and disk,
it's often far more efficient to send a batch of N small items all at
once than it is to send or write them one at a time. This kind of
batching is only effective if the leader sees many client requests at
the same time; so it depends on there being lots of active clients.

The second aspect of pipelining is that ZooKeeper makes it easy for
each client to keep many write requests outstanding at a time, by
supporting asynchronous operations. From the client's point of view,
it can send lots of write requests without having to wait for the
responses (which arrive later, as notifications after the writes
commit). From the leader's point of view, that client behavior gives
the leader lots of requests to accumulate into big efficient batches.

A worry with pipelining is that operations that are in flight might be
re-ordered, which would cause the problem that the authors discuss
2.3. If the leader has many write operations in flight followed by the
creation of "ready", you don't want those operations to be re-ordered,
because then other clients may observe "ready" before the preceding
writes have been applied. To ensure that this cannot happen, Zookeeper
guarantees FIFO order for a client's operations; that is, ZooKeeper
applies operations in the order that the client issued them. This
guarantee is per-client; there's no guarantee about the order of
concurrent operations from different clients.

Q: How does the leader know the order in which a client wants a bunch
of asynchronous updates to be performed?

A: The paper doesn't say. The answer is likely to involve the client's
ZooKeeper library numbering its asynchronous requests, and the leader
tracking for each client (really session) what number it should next
expect. This information would have to be preserved when a leader
fails and another server takes over, so the client sequence numbers
are likely passed along in replicated log entries.

Q: What does wait-free mean?

A: The precise definition: A wait-free implementation of a concurrent
data object is one that guarantees that any process can complete any
operation in a finite number of steps, regardless of the execution
speeds of the other processes. This definition was introduced in the
following paper by Herlihy:
https://cs.brown.edu/~mph/Herlihy91/p124-herlihy.pdf

Zookeeper is wait-free because it processes one client's requests
without needing to wait for other clients to take action. This is
partially a consequence of the API: despite being designed to support
client/client coordination and synchronization, no ZooKeeper API call
is defined in a way that would require one client to wait for another.
In contrast, a system that provided a lock acquire operation that
waited for the current lock holder to release the lock would not be
wait-free.

Ultimately, however, ZooKeeper clients often need to wait for each
other, with watches or polling. The main effect of wait-freedom on the
API is that watches are factored out from other operations. The
combination of atomic test-and-set updates (e.g. file creation and
writes conditional on version) with watches allows clients to synthesize
more complex blocking abstractions (e.g. Section 2.4's locks and
barriers).

Q: What does a client do if it doesn't get a reply for a request? Does
it re-send, in case the network lost a request or reply, or the leader
crashed before committing? How does ZooKeeper avoid re-sends leading
to duplicate executions?

A: The paper doesn't say. Probably the leader tracks what request
numbers from each session it has received and committed, so that it
can filter out duplicate requests. If a client sends a request at
about the same time that ZooKeeper decides to expire the client's
session, the client may not be able to tell if the request actually
executed.

Q: If a client submits an asynchronous write, and immediately
afterwards does a read, will the read see the effect of the write?

A: The paper doesn't explicitly say, but the implication of the "FIFO
client order" property of Section 2.3 is that the read will see the
write. That implies that a ZK follower will block a read until the
follower has received (from the ZK leader) all of the client's
preceding writes. The follower is in a position to do this because a
client session sends all requests (read and write) to the same
follower, which therefor will be aware that the client has issued a
write that hasn't yet appeared in the stream of committed operations
from the leader.

Q: What is the reason for 'fuzzy snapshots'?

A: ZooKeeper needs to write its state to disk so that it can recover
from a power failure (by reading the data from the disk). It does this
by appending every write operation to a log on the disk, and (to
prevent that log from growing too long) it periodically writes a
"snapshot" of its entire state (all the data) to disk and truncates
the log. Thus the most most recent snapshot plus the log since that
snapshot contain all the data.

A precise snapshot would correspond to a specific point in the log:
the snapshot would include every write before that point, and no
writes after that point; and it would be clear exactly where to start
replay of log entries after a reboot to bring the snapshot up to date.
However, creation of a precise snapshot requires a way to prevent any
writes from happening while the snapshot is being created and written
to disk. Blocking writes for the duration of snapshot creation might
decrease performance a lot.

The "fuzzy" refers to the fact that ZooKeeper creates the snapshot
from its in-memory database while allowing writes to the database.
This means that a snapshot does not correspond to a particular point
in the log -- a snapshot includes a more or less random subset of the
writes that were concurrent with snapshot creation. After reboot,
ZooKeeper constructs a consistent snapshot by replaying all log
entries from the point at which the snapshot started, in order.
Because logged updates in Zookeeper are idempotent and describe the
state resulting from the client operation, the application-state will
be correct after reboot and replay---some messages may be applied
twice (once to the state before recovery and once after recovery) but
that is OK, because they are idempotent. The replay fixes the fuzzy
snapshot to be a consistent snapshot of the application state.

The Zookeeper leader turns the operations in the client API into
idempotent transactions. For example, if a client issues a conditional
setData and the version number in the request matches, the Zookeeper
leader creates a setDataTXN that contains the new data, the new
version number, and updated time stamps. This transaction (TXN) is
idempotent: Zookeeper can execute it twice and it will result in the
same state.

Q: What's an example of a situation where it's important that
ZooKeeper transform client operations to an idempotent form?

A: create(path, data, flags=sequential) isn't idempotent because
executing it twice produces a different result than executing
it once: executing it twice produces two znodes, with different
numbers in their names.

The ZooKeeper leader transforms operations to make them idempotent by
computing the outcome; for sequential create, that includes the number
for the created znode. It's these transformed operations that are put in
the log and sent to followers.

Idempotence is important for the fuzzy snapshot scheme. A fuzzy snapshot
does not capture an exact prefix of the log; instead, some operations
towards the end of the log might be included in the snapshot, and some
not. Suppose that while ZK was creating a fuzzy snapshot, this client
request arrived:

  create("x", "a", flags=sequential)

Assume that the "flags=sequential" caused the ZK leader to assign number
7 to the znode, so that it creates znode "x7". And that the newly
created znode "x7" exists both in the fuzzy snapshot and (as an
idempotent operation) in the log.

If the ZK server then rebooted, and restored its state by loading the
snapshot from disk and replaying the log, we don't want the replayed
create to create a new znode with the next highest number, which would
be "x8". We want ZK to notice that the create() is already reflected in
the server's state, and not repeat it. The transformation to idempotent
operations accomplishes this.

Q: How is the ZooKeeper leader chosen?

A: Zookeeper uses ZAB, an atomic broadcast system, which has leader
election built in, much like Raft. Here's a paper about Zab:
http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2056409

Q: How does Zookeeper's performance compare to other systems
such as Paxos?

A: Zookeeper has impressive performance (in particular throughput).
Three Zookeeper servers process 21,000 writes per second. Typical
6.5840 Rafts with 3 servers commit on the order of tens of operations
per second (assuming a magnetic disk for storage) and maybe hundreds
per second with SSDs.

Q: How big is the ZooKeeper database? It seems like the server must
have a lot of memory.

Q: It depends on the application, and, unfortunately, the paper doesn't
report the authors' experience in this area. Since Zookeeper is
intended for configuration and coordination, and not as a
general-purpose data store, an in-memory database seems reasonable.
For example, you could imagine using Zookeeper for GFS's coordinator and
that amount of data should fit in the memory of a well-equipped
server, as it did for GFS.

Q: What's a universal object?

A: It is a theoretical statement of how good the API of Zookeeper is
based on a theory of concurrent objects that Herlihy introduced:
https://cs.brown.edu/~mph/Herlihy91/p124-herlihy.pdf. We won't
spend any time on this statement and theory, but if you care there is
a gentle introduction on this Wikipedia page:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_algorithm.

The authors appeal to this concurrent-object theory in order to show
that Zookeeper's API is general-purpose: that the API includes enough
features to implement any coordination scheme you'd want.

Q: When might one use a double barrier?

A: Here's a use for a single barrier: suppose you have a big
computation that proceeds in two phases. All of the results for phase
1 must be available before phase 2 can begin. Suppose you run each
phase in parallel on many workers (like MapReduce's Map, and then
Reduce). A barrier can be used to enforce "all workers must finish
phase 1 before any can start phase 2". If you have many phases, or a
loop in which each iteration is a phase, you might want a double
barrier.

Q: How does a client know when to leave one of the paper's double barriers?

A: Leaving the barrier involves each client watching the znodes for
all other clients participating in the barrier. Each client waits for
all of these znodes to disappear. Once they are all gone, the clients
all leave the barrier and continue computing.

Q: Is it possible to add more servers to an existing ZooKeeper service
without taking the service down?

A: It is -- although when the original paper was published, cluster
membership was static. Nowadays, ZooKeeper supports "dynamic
reconfiguration":

https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.5.3-beta/zookeeperReconfig.html

... and there is a paper describing the mechanism:

https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/atc12/atc12-final74.pdf

How do you think this compares to Raft's dynamic configuration change
via overlapping consensus, which appeared two years later?

Q: How are watches implemented in the client library?

A: The client library probably registers a callback function that will
be invoked when the watch triggers.

For example, a Go client for ZooKeeper implements it by passing a
channel into "GetW()" (get with watch); when the watch triggers, an
"Event" structure is sent through the channel. The application can
check the channel in a select clause.

See https://godoc.org/github.com/samuel/go-zookeeper/zk#Conn.GetW.

Q: Why does the read lock on page 6 in the code jump to line 3 instead
of line 2 like the write lock does?

A: Good catch; I believe it is a bug. The correct recipe is here:
https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.1.2/recipes.html#Shared+Locks

Q: Section 5.2 says the request latency for a write is 1.2
milliseconds. Isn't that less than the time required for a single hard
disk write?

A: I don't know what's going on here. Section 4 says each new log
entry is forced to disk, and seems to imply that ZooKeeper waits for
the data to be on disk before proceeding. The wait seems necessary for
crash recovery -- it would be bad to tell a client that a write had
succeeded, only to forget about it in a power failure. How long might
a disk write take? Section 5 says they use mechanical hard drives, and
appending an entry to a log file on disk takes at least half a
rotation on average. A typical disk spins at 7200 RPM, which means a
half rotation takes about 4 milliseconds, which is longer than the
reported overall latency.

If the paper were published today, and said it used SSDs instead of
hard drives, the 1.2 millisecond latency would make more sense, since
one can write an SSD in much less than a millisecond. Another way to
get fast writes is to interpose a battery-backed cache between the
software and the disk -- the point of the battery is to preserve
recent writes despite power failures, so they can be written to disk
after the power is restored.

Q: Is ZooKeeper widely used in real life?

A: Yes; have a look here for a partial list of projects and companies
that use ZooKeeper:

https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.8.4/zookeeperUseCases.html

Q: ZooKeeper includes many detailed design decisions about the API and
its semantics; have these turned out to be the right ones?

A: ZooKeeper has spurred the development of newer systems with
arguably better detailed designs. One example is etcd, which is aimed
at the same use cases as ZooKeeper, but differs in a bunch of ways
explained here:

  https://etcd.io/docs/v3.3/learning/why/

Q: Why did the authors choose the name ZooKeeper?

A: The apache zookeeper web site says this: "ZooKeeper: Because
Coordinating Distributed Systems is a Zoo"
