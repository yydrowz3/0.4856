Q: What problem does linearizability solve?

A: The problem being solved is fulfilling the need for a consistency
model: a definition of correct client-visible behavior of a network
service in the face of concurrent requests from multiple clients, lost
and re-transmitted requests, communication delays, server replication,
server failure and recovery, and server sharding. A consistency model
helps programmers design applications (clients) so that they provide
the behavior the programmers intend. And it helps service designers
decide whether specific design decisions are OK or not.

Here's an example of the kind of question linearizability can help
answer. Suppose we have a replicated storage service (like GFS).
Client C1 sends a write RPC for a certain key and receives a "success"
reply; after that, client C2 sends a read RPC for the same key and
receives a value back; no other clients modify that key; is C2
guaranteed to see C1's write? The answer to this question is important
for the design of the storage service, since it affects whether
replicas can serve reads, whether updates must be preserved if servers
crash, whether caches must be kept strictly up to date, &c.

Linearizability's answer is yes, C2 must see C1's write. And as a
result, a linearizable storage system often involves complex and
expensive management of replication, crash recovery, caching, &c.

Q: What's the definition of linearizability?

A: Linearizability is defined on "histories": traces of client
operations, annotated by the time at which each client operation
starts (is launched by a client), and the time at which the client
sees that the operation has finished. Linearizability tells you if an
individual history is legal. We say that a service is linearizable if
every history it can generate is linearizable.

There is one event in the history for a client starting an operation,
and another for the client deciding the operation has finished. Thus
the history makes concurrency among clients, and network delays,
explicit. Typically the start and finish events correspond to a
request and a response message exchanged with the server.

A history is linearizable if you can assign a "linearization point" (a
time) to each operation, where each operation's point lies between the
times of its start and finish events, and the history's response
values are the same as you'd get if you executed the operations one at
a time in point order. If no assignment of linearization points
satisfies these two requirements, the history is not linearizable.

Q: Why is linearizability a desirable consistency model?

A: Because it is relatively strong, in the sense of forbidding many
"anomalous" behaviours that might cause problems for application
programmers. Services with stronger consistency guarantees tend to be
easier for programmers to design for than weaker ones.

For example, suppose one part of an application computes a value,
writes it to the storage system, and then sets a flag in the storage
system indicating that the computed value is ready:

  v = compute...
  put("value", v)
  put("done", true)

On a different computer a program checks "done" to see if the value is
available, and uses it if it is:

  if get("done") == true:
    v = get("value")
    print v

If the storage system that implements put() and get() is linearizable,
the above programs will work as expected.

With many weaker consistency models, the above programs will not work
as one might hope. For example, a storage system providing "eventual
consistency" might re-order the two puts (so that "done" is true even
though "value" is not available), or might yield a stale (old) value
for either of the get()s.

Q: When trying to demonstrate that a history is linearizable, how does
one decide where to place the linearization point for each operation?

A: The idea is that, in order to show that an execution is
linearizable, you (the human) need to find places to put the little
orange lines (linearization points). That is, in order to show that a
history is linearizable, you need to find an assignment of
linearization points (and thus an order of operations) that conforms
to these requirements:

  * All function calls have a linearization point at some instant
    between their invocation and their response.

  * All functions appear to occur instantly at their linearization
    point, behaving as specified by the sequential definition.

So, some placements of linearization points are invalid because they lie
outside of the time span of a request; others are invalid because they
violate the sequential definition (for a key/value store, a violation means
that a read does not observe the most recently written value, where
"recent" refers to linearization points).

For a complex history you may need to try many assignments of
linearization points in order to find one that demonstrates that the
history is linearizable. If you try them all, and none works, then the
history is not linearizable.

Q: Why not use the time at which the client sent the command as the
linearization point? I.e. have the system execute operations in the
order that clients sent them?

A: It's hard to build a system that guarantees that behavior -- the
start time is the time at which the client code issued the request,
but the service might not receive the request until much later due to
network delays. That is, requests may arrive at the service in an
order that's quite different from the order of start times. The
service could in principle delay execution of every arriving request
in case a request with an earlier issue time arrives later, but it's
hard to know how long to wait since networks can impose unbounded
delays. And it would increase delays for every request, perhaps by a
lot. That said, Spanner, which we'll look at later, uses a related
technique.

A correctness specification like linearizability needs to walk a fine
line between being lax enough to implement efficiently, but strict
enough to provide useful guarantees to application programs. "Appears to
execute operations in invocation order" is too strict to implement
efficiently, whereas linearizability's "appears to execute somewhere
between invocation and response" is implementable though not as
straightforward for application programmers.

Q: How do services implement linearizability?

A: If the service is implemented as a single server, with no
replication or caching or internal parallelism, it's nearly enough for
the service to execute client requests one a time as they arrive. One
complication comes from clients that re-send requests because they
think the network has lost messages: for requests with side-effects,
the service must take care to execute any given client request only
once. Replication, fault tolerance, and caching involve further design
complexity.

An nice consequence of linearizability is that the service has freedom
in the order in which it executes concurrent (overlapping-in-time)
operations. In particular, if operations from client C1 and C2 are
concurrent, the server could execute C2's operation first even if C1
started before C2. On the other hand, if C1 finished before C2
started, linearizability requires the service to act as if it executed
C1's operation before C2's (i.e. C2's operation is required to observe
the effects of C1's operation, if any).

Q: What are other consistency models?

A: Look for

    eventual consistency
    causal consistency
    fork consistency
    serializability
    sequential consistency
    timeline consistency

And there are others from the worlds of databases, CPU memory/cache
systems, and file systems.

In general, different models differ in how intuitive they are for
application programmers, and how much performance you can get with
them. For example, eventual consistency allows many anomalous results
(e.g. even if a write has completed, subsequent reads might not see
it), but in a distributed/replicated setting can be implemented with
higher performance than linearizability.

Q: Why is linearizability used as a consistency model versus other ones,
such as eventual consistency?

A: People do often build storage systems that provide consistency weaker
than linearizability, such as eventual and causal consistency.

Linearizability has some nice properties for application writers:

  * reads always observe fresh data.
  * if there are no concurrent writes, all readers see the
    same data.
  * on most linearizable systems you can add mini-transactions
    like test-and-set (because most linearizable designs end up
    executing operations on each data item one-at-a-time).

Weaker schemes like eventual and causal consistency can allow higher
performance, since they don't require all copies of data to be updated
right away. This higher performance is often the deciding factor. For
some applications weak consistency causes no problems, for example if
one is storing data items that are never updated, such as images or
video.

However, weak consistency introduces some complexity for application
writers:

  * reads can observe out-of-date (stale) data.
  * reads can observe writes out of order.
  * if you write, and then read, you may not see your write,
    but instead see stale data.
  * concurrent updates to the same items aren't executed
    one-at-a-time, so it's hard to to implement mini-transactions
    like test-and-set or atomic increment.

Q: Linearizability doesn't seem particularly "strong", since you can
be reading different data even when you execute two commands at the
same time; are there stronger notions?

A: True, linearizability is reminiscent of using threads in a program
without using locks. It's possible to program correctly this way but
it requires care.

An example of a stronger notion of consistency is transactions, as
found in many databases, which effectively lock any data used. For
programs that read and write multiple data items, transactions make
programming easier than linearizability. "Serializability" is the name
of one consistency model that provides transactions.

However, transaction systems are significantly more complex, slower, and
harder to make fault-tolerant than linearizable systems.

Q: Is it a problem that concurrent get()s might see different values if
there's also a concurrent put()?

A: It's often not a problem in the context of storage systems. For
example, if the value we're talking about is my profile photograph,
and two different people ask to see it at the same time that I'm
updating the photo, then it's reasonable for them to see different
photos (either the old or new one).

Another way of looking at this is that it's the same behavior that
programmers already are familiar with on multi-core computers:
concurrent loads from different cores of a memory location that's
simultaneously being written are not guaranteed to all see the same
value.

Q: What are some examples of real-world linearizable storage systems?
And of storage systems with weaker consistency guarantees?

A: Google's Spanner and Amazon's S3 are storage systems that provide
linearizability.

Google's GFS, Amazon's Dynamo, and Cassandra provide weaker
consistency; they are probably best classified as eventually
consistent.

Q: What do people do to ensure their distributed systems are correct?

A: Thorough testing is a common plan, perhaps using a linearizability
checker such as Porcupine.

Use of formal methods is also common; have a look here for some
examples:

Q: How hard is it to formally prove a service to be correct?

A: It turns out that proving significant theorems about complex
programs is difficult -- much more difficult than ordinary
programming.

You can get a feel for this by trying the labs for this course:

Q: How does a team decide that they have tested a product thoroughly
enough to ship to customers?

A: It's a good idea to start shipping product, and getting revenue,
before your company runs out of money and goes bankrupt. People test
as much as they can before that point, and usually try to persuade a
few early customers to use the product (and help reveal bugs) with the
understanding that it might not work correctly. Maybe you are ready to
ship when the product is functional enough to satisfy many customers
and has no known major bugs.

Independent of this, a wise customer will also test software that they
depend on. No serious organization expects any software to be bug-free.

Q: How do linearizability checkers work?

A: A simple linearizability checker would try every possible order (or
choice of linearization points) to see if one is valid according to
the rules in the definition of linearizability. Because that would be
too slow on big histories, clever checkers avoid looking at clearly
impossible orders (e.g. if a proposed linearization point is before
the operation's start time), decompose the history into sub-histories
that can be checked separately when that's possible, and use
heuristics to try more likely orders first.

These papers describe the techniques; I believe Knossos is based on the
first paper, and Porcupine adds ideas from the second paper:

Q: Are there examples of real-world systems tested with Porcupine or
similar testing frameworks?

A: Such testing is common -- for example, have a look at
https://jepsen.io/analyses; Jepsen is an organization that has tested
the correctness (and linearizability, where appropriate) of many storage
systems.

For Porcupine specifically, here's an example:
