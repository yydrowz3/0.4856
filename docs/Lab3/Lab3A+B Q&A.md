6.5840 Lecture 10: lab 3 A+B Q&A

Two different structures of Raft library
  multi-threaded with locks
  single-threaded state-machine 
  neither one is strictly better than the other
  other plans are possible

Correctness in distributed systems:
 safety: never returning an incorrect result
 liveness: eventually returning a result
 Q: give an example of a safety and liveness bug in your solution

Getting started on a lab
  make first test case work
   fill out VoteRequest structs
   do an RPC
  then much easier to get the lay of the land
  other strategy: read all guides, read test code, etc.

Debugging
  Run with race detector
  Log all action/messages in easy searchable way
   standard format: src, dst, opcode, raft state,..
  Run test case
    if ok:
      next test case
    if fail:
      repeat:
        study test case
        formulate hypothesis about what might be wrong
        study log and figure 2, run with race detector
        modify code and try test again

Multi-threaded Raft library
  many threads (Start() thread, thread reading from applych)
  many RPC threads to talk to peers in parallel
  many RPC handler threads (started by RPC package)
  raft state with lock
  one thread writing to applych
    use condvar to signal it

Locking
  Raft lock serializes operations
  RPC handlers hold Raft lock so are atomic
    little parallelism
  Threads don't hold lock during RPC
    risk: deadlock if locks are held during RPC

Single-threaded state-machine
  observation: little parallelism anyway
    main use: sending RPCs in parallel
  one thread runs Raft protocol
    receives input events (e.g., tick, RPC request, reply)
    process event, updating raft structure, without locks
      collecting output events (persist, send RPCs)
    performs output events
      first persist, then RPC requests
  one thread for the applier
    need to separate state between applier and state-machine
    protect shared state with lock (e.g., the log)

Code tour
  Raft struct
  Ticker
  Election timeout
  Start election
  VoteRequest handling
  becomeLeader
  send appends
  AppendEntries request handling
  AppendEntries reply handling
  commit
  applier
  Start()
