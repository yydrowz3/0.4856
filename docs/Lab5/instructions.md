6.5840 Lab 5: Sharded Key/Value Service

Collaboration policy // Submit lab // Setup Go // Guidance // Piazza
Introduction

You can either do a final project based on your own ideas, or this lab.

In this lab you'll build a key/value storage system that "shards," or partitions, the keys over a set of Raft-replicated key/value server groups (shardgrps). A shard is a subset of the key/value pairs; for example, all the keys starting with "a" might be one shard, all the keys starting with "b" another, etc. The reason for sharding is performance. Each shardgrp handles puts and gets for just a few of the shards, and the shardgrps operate in parallel; thus total system throughput (puts and gets per unit time) increases in proportion to the number of shardgrps.

shardkv design

The sharded key/value service has the components shown above. Shardgrps (shown with blue squares) store shards with keys: shardgrp 1 holds a shard storing key "a", and shardgrp 2 holds a shard storing key "b". Clients of the sharded key/value service interact with the service through a clerk (shown with a green circle), which implements Get and Put methods. To find the shardgrp for a key passed to Put/Get, the clerk gets the configuration from the kvsrv (shown with a black square), which you implemented in Lab 2. The configuration (not shown) describes the mapping from shards to shardgrps (e.g., shard 1 is served by shardgrp 3).

An administrator (i.e., the tester) uses another client, the controller (shown with a purple circle), to add/remove shardgrps from the cluster and update which shardgrp should serve a shard. The controller has one main method: ChangeConfigTo, which takes as argument a new configuration and changes the system from the current configuration to the new configuration; this involves moving shards to new shardgrps that are joining the system and moving shards away from shardgrps that are leaving the system. To do so the controller 1) makes RPCs (FreezeShard, InstallShard, and DeleteShard) to shardgrps, and 2) updates the configuration stored in kvsrv.

The reason for the controller is that a sharded storage system must be able to shift shards among shardgrps. One reason is that some shardgrps may become more loaded than others, so that shards need to be moved to balance the load. Another reason is that shardgrps may join and leave the system: new shardgrps may be added to increase capacity, or existing shardgrps may be taken offline for repair or retirement.

The main challenges in this lab will be ensuring linearizability of Get/Put operations while handling 1) changes in the assignment of shards to shardgrps, and 2) recovering from a controller that fails or is partitioned during ChangeConfigTo.

    ChangeConfigTo moves shards from one shardgrp to another. A risk is that some clients might use the old shardgrp while other clients use the new shardgrp, which could break linearizability. You will need to ensure that at most one shardgrp is serving requests for each shard at any one time.
    If ChangeConfigTo fails while reconfiguring, some shards may be inaccessible if they have started but not completed moving from one shardgrp to another. To make forward progress, the tester starts a new controller, and your job is to ensure that the new one completes the reconfiguration that the previous controller started. 

This lab uses "configuration" to refer to the assignment of shards to shardgrps. This is not the same as Raft cluster membership changes. You don't have to implement Raft cluster membership changes.

A shardgrp server is a member of only a single shardgrp. The set of servers in a given shardgrp will never change.

Only RPC may be used for interaction among clients and servers. For example, different instances of your server are not allowed to share Go variables or files.

In Part A, you will implement a working shardctrler, which will store and retrieve configurations in a kvsrv. You will also implement the shardgrp, replicated with your Raft rsm package, and a corresponding shardgrp clerk. The shardctrler talks to the shardgrp clerks to move shards between different groups.

In Part B, you will modify your shardctrler to handle failures and partitions during config changes. In Part C, you will extend your shardctrler to allow for concurrent controllers without interfering with each other. Finally, in Part D, you will have the opportunity to extend your solution in any way you like.

This lab's sharded key/value service follows the same general design as Flat Datacenter Storage, BigTable, Spanner, FAWN, Apache HBase, Rosebud, Spinnaker, and many others. These systems differ in many details from this lab, though, and are also typically more sophisticated and capable. For example, the lab doesn't evolve the sets of peers in each Raft group; its data and query models are simple; and so on.

Lab 5 will use your kvsrv from Lab 2, and your rsm and Raft from Lab 4. Your Lab 5 and Lab 4 must use the same rsm and Raft implementations.

You may use late hours for Part A, but you may not use late hours for Parts B-D.
Getting Started

Do a git pull to get the latest lab software.

We supply you with tests and skeleton code in src/shardkv1:

    client.go for the shardkv clerk
    shardcfg package for computing shard configurations
    shardgrp package: for the shardgrp clerk and server.
    shardctrler package, which contains shardctrler.go with methods for the controller to change a configuration (ChangeConfigTo) and to get a configuration (Query) 

To get up and running, execute the following commands:

$ cd ~/6.5840
$ git pull
...
$ cd src
$ make RUN="-run 5A" shardkv
go build -race -o main/kvsrv1d main/kvsrv1d.go
go build -race -o main/shardgrp1d main/shardgrp1d.go
cd shardkv1; go test -timeout 15m -v -race -run 5A
=== RUN  TestInitQuery5A
Test (5A): Init and Query ... (reliable network)...
...

Part A: Moving shards (hard)

Your first job is to implement shardgrps and the InitConfig, Query, and ChangeConfigTo methods when there are no failures. We have given you the code for describing a configuration, in shardkv1/shardcfg. Each shardcfg.ShardConfig has a unique identifying number, a mapping from shard number to group number, and a mapping from group number to the list of servers replicating that group. There will usually be more shards than groups (so that each group serves more than one shard), in order that load can be shifted at a fairly fine granularity.

Implement these two methods in shardctrler/shardctrler.go:

    The InitConfig method receives the first configuration, passed to it by the tester as a shardcfg.ShardConfig. InitConfig should store the configuration in an instance of Lab 2's kvsrv.
    The Query method returns the current configuration; it should read the configuration from kvsrv, previously stored there by InitConfig. 

Implement InitConfig and Query, and store the configuration in kvsrv. You're done when your code passes the first test. Note this task doesn't require any shardgrps.

$ cd ~/6.5840/src
$ make RUN="-run TestInitQuery5A" shardkv
go build -race -o main/kvsrv1d main/kvsrv1d.go
go build -race -o main/shardgrp1d main/shardgrp1d.go
cd shardkv1; go test -timeout 15m -v -race -run TestInitQuery5A
=== RUN   TestInitQuery5A
Test (5A): Init and Query ... (reliable network)...
  ... Passed --  time  0.0s #peers 1 #RPCs     3 #Ops    0
--- PASS: TestInitQuery5A (0.13s)
PASS
ok  	6.5840/shardkv1	1.143s

    Implement InitConfig and Query by storing and reading the initial configuration from kvsrv: use the Get/Put methods of ShardCtrler.IKVClerk to talk to kvsrv, use the String method of ShardConfig to turn a ShardConfig into a string that you can pass to Put, and use the shardcfg.FromString() function to turn a string into a ShardConfig. 

Implement an initial version of shardgrp in shardkv1/shardgrp/server.go and a corresponding clerk in shardkv1/shardgrp/client.go by copying code from your Lab 4 kvraft solution.

Implement a clerk in shardkv1/client.go that uses the Query method to find the shardgrp for a key, and then talks to that shardgrp. You're done when your code passes the Static test.

$ cd ~/6.5840/src
$ make RUN="-run TestStatiOneShardGroup5A" shardkv
go build -race -o main/kvsrv1d main/kvsrv1d.go
go build -race -o main/shardgrp1d main/shardgrp1d.go
cd shardkv1; go test -timeout 15m -v -race -run TestStaticOneShardGroup5A
=== RUN   TestStaticOneShardGroup5A
Test (5A): one shard group ... (reliable network)...
  ... Passed --  time  9.4s #peers 1 #RPCs   822 #Ops  420
--- PASS: TestStaticOneShardGroup5A (9.52s)
PASS
ok  	6.5840/shardkv1	10.542s

    Copy code from your kvraft client.go and server.go for Put and Get, and any other code you need from kvraft.
    The code in shardkv1/client.go provides the Put/Get clerk for the overall system: it finds out which shardgrp holds the desired key's shard by invoking the Query method, and then talks to the shardgrp that holds that shard.
    Implement shardkv1/client.go, including its Put/Get methods. Use shardcfg.Key2Shard() to find the shard number for a key. The tester passes a ShardCtrler object to MakeClerk in shardkv1/client.go. Retrieve the current configuration using the Query method.
    To put/get a key from a shardgrp, the shardkv clerk should create a shardgrp clerk for the shardgrp by calling shardgrp.MakeClerk, passing in the servers found in the configuration and the shardkv clerk's ck.clnt. Use the GidServers() method from ShardConfig to get the group for a shard.
    shardkv1/client.go's Put must return ErrMaybe when the reply was maybe lost, but this Put invokes shardgrp's Put to talk a particular shardgrp. The inner Put can signal this with an error.
    Upon creation, the first shardgrp (shardcfg.Gid1) should initialize itself to own all shards. 

Now you should support movement of shards among groups by implementing the ChangeConfigTo method, which changes from an old configuration to a new configuration. The new configuration may include new shardgrps that are not present in the old configuration, and may exclude shardgrps that were present in the old configuration. The controller should move shards (the key/value data) so that the set of shards stored by each shardgrp matches the new configuration.

The approach we suggest for moving a shard is for ChangeConfigTo to first "freeze" the shard at the source shardgrp, causing that shardgrp to reject Put's for keys in the moving shard. Then, copy (install) the shard to the destination shardgrp; then delete the frozen shard. Finally, post a new configuration so that clients can find the moved shard. A nice property of this approach is that it avoids any direct interactions among the shardgrps. It also supports serving shards that are not affected by an ongoing configuration change.

To be able to order changes to the configuration, each configuration has a unique number Num (see shardcfg/shardcfg.go). The tester in Part A invokes ChangeConfigTo sequentially, and the configuration passed to ChangeConfigTo will have a Num one larger than the previous one; thus, a configuration with a higher Num is newer than one with a lower Num.

The network may delay RPCs, and RPCs may arrive out of order at the shardgrps. To reject old FreezeShard, InstallShard, and DeleteShard RPCs, they should include Num (see shardgrp/shardrpc/shardrpc.go), and shardgrps must remember the largest Num they have seen for each shard.

Implement ChangeConfigTo (in shardctrler/shardctrler.go) and extend shardgrp to support freeze, install, and delete. ChangeConfigTo should always succeed in Part A because the tester doesn't induce failures in this part. You will need to implement FreezeShard, InstallShard, and DeleteShard in shardgrp/client.go and shardgrp/server.go using the RPCs in the shardgrp/shardrpc package, and reject old RPCs based on Num. You will also need modify the shardkv clerk in shardkv1/client.go to handle ErrWrongGroup, which a shardgrp should return if it isn't reponsible for the shard.

You have completed this task when you pass the JoinBasic and DeleteBasic tests. These tests focus on adding shardgrps; you don't have to worry about shardgrps leaving just yet.

    A shardgrp should respond with an ErrWrongGroup error to a client Put/Get with a key that the shardgrp isn't responsible for (i.e., for a key whose shard is not assigned to the shardgrp). You will have to modify shardkv1/client.go to reread the configuration and retry the Put/Get.
    Note that you will have to run FreezeShard, InstallShard, and DeleteShard through your rsm package, just like Put and Get.
    You can send an entire map as your state in an RPC request or reply, which may help keep the code for shard transfer simple.
    If one of your RPC handlers includes in its reply a map (e.g. a key/value map) that's part of your server's state, you may get bugs due to races. The RPC system has to read the map in order to send it to the caller, but it isn't holding a lock that covers the map. Your server, however, may proceed to modify the same map while the RPC system is reading it. The solution is for the RPC handler to include a copy of the map in the reply. 

Extend ChangeConfigTo to handle shard groups that leave; i.e., shardgrps that are present in the current configuration but not in the new one. Your solution should pass TestJoinLeaveBasic5A now. (You may have handled this scenario already in the previous task, but the previous tests didn't test for shardgrps leaving.)

Make your solution pass all Part A tests, which check that your sharded key/value service supports many groups joining and leaving, shardgrps restarting from snapshots, processing Gets while some shards are offline or involved in a configuration change, and linearizability when many clients interact with the service while the tester concurrently invokes the controller's ChangeConfigTo to rebalance shards.

Your solution must continue serving shards that are not affected by an ongoing configuration change.
Part B: Handling a failed controller (easy)

The controller is a short-lived command, which an administrator invokes: it moves shards and then exits. But, it may fail or lose network connectivity while moving shards. The main task in this part of the lab is recovering from a controller that fails to complete ChangeConfigTo. The tester starts a new controller and invokes its ChangeConfigTo after partitioning the first controller; you have to modify the controller so that the new one finishes the reconfiguration. The tester calls InitController when starting a controller; you can modify that function to check whether an interrupted configuration change needs to be completed.

A good approach to allowing a controller to finish a reconfiguration that a previous one started is to keep two configurations: a current one and a next one, both stored in the controller's kvsrv. When a controller starts a reconfiguration, it stores the next configuration. Once a controller completes the reconfiguration, it makes the next configuration the current one. Modify InitController to first check if there is a stored next configuration with a higher configuration number than the current one, and if so, complete the shard moves necessary to reconfigure to the next one.

Modify shardctrler to implement the above approach. A controller that picks up the work from a failed controller may repeat FreezeShard, InstallShard, and Delete RPCs; shardgrps can use Num to detect duplicates and reject them. You have completed this task if your solution passes the Part B tests.

$ cd ~/6.5840/src
$ make RUN="-run 5B" shardkv
go build -race -o main/kvsrv1d main/k
go build -race -o main/shardgrp1d main/shardgrp1d.go
cd shardkv1; go test -timeout 15m -v -race -run 5B

PASS
ok      6.5840/shardkv1 35.805s
$

    The tester calls InitController when starting a controller; you can implement recovery in that method in shardctrler/shardctrler.go. 

Part C: Concurrent configuration changes (moderate)

In this part of the lab you will modify the controller to allow for concurrent controllers. When a controller crashes or is partitioned, the tester will start a new controller, which must finish any work that the old controller might have in progress (i.e., finishing moving shards like in Part B). This means that several controllers may run concurrently and send RPCs to the shardgrps and the kvsrv that stores configurations.

The main challenge is to ensure these controllers don't step on each other. In Part A you already fenced all the shardgrp RPCs with Num so that old RPCs are rejected. Even if several controllers pick up the work of an old controller concurrently, one of them succeeds and the others repeat all the RPCs, the shardgrps will ignore them.

Thus the challenging case left is to ensure that only one controller updates the next configuration to avoid that two controllers (e.g., a partitioned one and a new one) put different configurations in the next one. To stress this scenario, the tester runs several controllers concurrently and each one computes the next configuration by reading the current configuration and updating it for a shardgrp that left or joined, and then the tester invokes ChangeConfigTo; thus multiple controllers may invoke ChangeConfigTo with different configuration with the same Num. You can use the version number of a key and versioned Puts to ensure that only one controller updates the next configuration and that the other invocations return without doing anything.

Modify your controller so that only one controller can post a next configuration for a configuration Num. The tester will start many controllers but only one should start ChangeConfigTo for a new configuation. You have completed this task if you pass the concurrent tests of Part C:

$ cd ~/6.5840/src
$ make RUN="-run TestConcurrentReliable5C" shardkv
go build -race -o main/kvsrv1d main/k
go build -race -o main/shardgrp1d main/shardgrp1d.go
cd shardkv1; go test -timeout 15m -v -race -run TestConcurrentReliable5C
Test (5C): Concurrent ctrlers ... (reliable network)...
  ... Passed --  time  8.2s #peers 1 #RPCs  1753 #Ops  120
PASS
ok      6.5840/shardkv1 8.364s
$ make RUN="-run TestAcquireLockConcurrentUnreliable5C" shardkv
go build -race -o main/kvsrv1d main/k
go build -race -o main/shardgrp1d main/shardgrp1d.go
cd shardkv1; go test -timeout 15m -v -race -run TestAcquireLockConcurrentUnreliable5C
Test (5C): Concurrent ctrlers ... (unreliable network)...
  ... Passed --  time 23.8s #peers 1 #RPCs  1850 #Ops  120
PASS
ok      6.5840/shardkv1 24.008s
$

    See concurCtrler in test.go to see how the tester runs controllers concurrently. 

In this exercise you will put recovery of an old controller together with a new controller: a new controller should perform recovery from Part B. If the old controller was partitioned during ChangeConfigTo, you will have to make sure that the old controller doesn't interfere with the new controller. If all the controller's updates are already properly fenced with Num checks from Part B, you don't have to write extra code. You have completed this task if you pass the Partition tests.

You have completed implementing a highly-available sharded key/value service with many shard groups for scalability, reconfiguration to handle changes in load, and with a fault-tolerant controller; congrats!

Rerun all tests to check that your recent changes to the controller haven't broken earlier tests.

Gradescope will rerun the Lab 3A-D and Lab 4A-C tests on your submission, in addition to the 5C tests. Before submitting, double check that your solution works:

$ make raft1
$ make kvraft1
$ make shardkv

Part D: Extend your solution

In this final part of the lab, you get to extend your solution in any way you like. You will have to write your own tests for whatever extensions you choose to implement.

Implement one of the ideas below or come up with your own idea. Write a paragraph in a file extension.md describing your extension, and upload extension.md to Gradescope. If you would like to do one of the harder, open-ended extensions, feel free to partner up with another student in the class.

Here are some ideas for possible extension (the first few are easy and the later ones are more open ended):

    (easy) Change the tester to use kvraft instead of kvsrv (i.e., replace the kvsrv.StartKVServer in MakeTestMaxRaft in test.go with kvraft.StartKVServer) so that the controller uses your kvraft to store its configuration. Write a test that checks that the controller can query and update the configuration while one of the kvraft peers is down. The existing code for the tester is distributed across src/kvtest1, src/shardkv1, and src/tester1.
    (moderate) Change kvsrv to implement exactly-once semantics for Put/Get as in Lab 2 from last year (see the dropped messages part). You may be able to port over some tests from 2024 instead of having to write your own from scratch. Implement exactly-once also in your kvraft.
    (moderate) Change kvsrv to support a Range function, which returns all keys in the range low key to high key. The lazy way to implement Range is to iterate through the key/value map that the server maintains; a better way is to use a data structure that supports range searches (e.g., B-tree). Include a test that fails the lazy solution but passes on the better solution.
    (hard) Modify your kvraft implementation to allow the leader to serve Gets without running the Get through rsm. That is, implement the optimization described at the end of section 8 of the raft paper, including leases, to ensure that kvraft maintains linearizability. Your implementation should pass the existing kvraft tests. You should also add a test that checks that your optimized implementation is faster (e.g., by comparing the number of RPCs) and a test that checks that term switches are slower because a new leader must wait until the lease has expired.
    (hard) Support transactions in kvraft so that a developer can perform several Put and Gets atomically. Once you have transaction, you don't need version Puts anymore; transactions subsume versioned Puts. Look at etcd's transactions for an example interface. Write tests to demonstrate your extension works.
    (hard) Modify shardkv to support transactions so that a developer can perform several Puts and Gets atomically across shards. This requires implementing two-phase-commit and two-phase locking. Write tests to demonstrate that your extension works.
